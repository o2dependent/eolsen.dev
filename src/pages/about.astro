						I’m a full-stack software architect with a proven track record of
						engineering high-impact, scalable solutions across industries. My
						expertise spans the entire development lifecycle—from crafting
						pixel-perfect, user-centric interfaces to designing resilient,
						enterprise-grade backend systems. What sets me apart? A rare fusion
						of technical precision and design intuition, paired with a
						relentless focus on delivering business value through innovation.

			<p class="font-medium text-2xl text-white">Core Strengths:</p>
			<ul class="text-lg ml-4 list-disc flex flex-col gap-1 text-white/80">
				<li>
					Architected systems optimized for performance, security, and
					scalability using TypeScript and Node.js.
				</li>

				<li>
					Led UI/UX redesigns that boosted user engagement by 40%+ through
					TypeScript-driven frontends and data-driven design principles.
				</li>

				<li>
					Designed mission-critical databases (SQL/NoSQL) with sub-10ms query
					latency, powering real-time analytics for clients.
				</li>

				<li>
					Pioneered DevOps pipelines (CI/CD, AWS, GitHub/GitLab) that reduced
					deployment cycles by 70% while ensuring 99.99% uptime.
				</li>

				<li>
					Translated complex business logic into clean, maintainable codebases
					using TypeScript and domain-driven design, slashing technical debt by
					60% for cross-functional teams.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="font-medium text-2xl text-white">Why I Stand Out:</p>
			<ul class="text-lg ml-4 list-disc flex flex-col gap-1 text-white/80">
				<li>
					Full-Stack Agility: From designing intuitive user experiences to
					building distributed microservices, I bridge the gap between
					aesthetics and engineering rigor.
				</li>

				<li>
					Strategic Problem-Solving: I don’t just write code—I solve business
					challenges. My solutions have driven operational efficiencies for
					startups and enterprises alike.
				</li>

				<li>
					Future-Proof Code: A relentless advocate for clean architecture and
					type-safe systems (TypeScript/Go), I build software that evolves with
					market demands.
				</li>

				<li>
					Leadership Through Innovation: Mentored 5+ engineers, authored
					internal frameworks adopted company-wide, and championed agile
					practices that accelerated product launches.
				</li>
