For my entire life, I've struggled with anxiety and panic attacks that would generally happen at work, school, and other social environments. I always thought I just had horrible social anxiety, but no medication or treatment helped so I gave up and just tried to deal with it for the past six years. I eventually developed extreme agoraphobia and that's where I've been for the past two to three years.

During my time inside I tried to figure out why my brain worked the way it did. I looked into a myriad of different disorders to try to see what was wrong but struggled to find something that matched my lived experience. Then one day while I was looking at art from the artist WolfSkullJack when I saw a post where she mentioned that she was diagnosed with autism and that is what was causing her panic attacks. I didn't know autistic burnout and overstimulation could cause panic attacks. I've talked with several therapists and psychiatrists who never even considered autism as a possibility. I then took a bunch of autism tests on [Embrace Autism](https://embrace-autism.com/autism-tests/) where I got pretty high scores on nearly every assessment, indicating that I am very likely autistic.

<p style="font-size: 12px; opacity: 0.5;">Very funny that it essentially says 100% autistic lol.</p>

## Masking caused anxiety

After considering autism as a possibility I did research on what causes autistic burnout and found that masking can contribute to anxiety, depression, and burnout. I have always tried to "act normal" around people and thought that's just what everyone did, but I didn't realize how much I was masking and how much of a toll it's taken on my mental health. I've been extremely anxious since I was a child and never had the best grasp on how other people seem to act normal. I was bullied for doing weird stuff like walking on my toes with my wrists limp when I was very young and as I got older the more "weird" things I would do kept piling up. I would always have to avoid doing those things to be "normal" and never realized how much that contributed to my anxiety.

## Sensory overload

I've had panic attacks my whole life, but most of the time it wasn't easy to figure out why it would happen and how to stop it. I eventually just gave up and didn't go anywhere, learning about my agoraphobic tendencies since it seemed like there were two options. Have panic attacks around a bunch of people or just by myself. Reading about autism and sensory overload, a lot of my panic attacks began to make sense. In college, I worked in a pizza shop that was incredibly loud and had a lot of intense scents. I then worked as a software developer at Crowdhub which had a super loud A/C system going all the time, loud music playing every day, and bright lights beaming on me. I would have a panic attack nearly every day I went to work at both these places. When I worked at Crowdhub I eventually just asked to work from home because of how prevalent the issue was and had significantly fewer panic attacks. I never considered that overstimulation could be causing these issues, but in retrospect, it fits together perfectly with my experiences.

## How I'm moving forward

With the support of my partner, I've been able to find how I've been masking and better understand what has been causing my extreme baseline anxiety. She has helped in getting me out more and has been incredibly supportive in getting me back on my feet. I plan to write about a few other things that have helped me while dealing with agoraphobia and autism so if you are interested in that keep an eye out.
