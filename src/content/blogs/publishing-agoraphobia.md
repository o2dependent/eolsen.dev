This is going to be a more personal blog about how my anxiety and agoraphobia has effected the way I share my work. If you aren't interested in that or feel you may judge me for either of those things [you should check this out instead](/music). I normally write code for computers so if the words I write for humans is rough don't be surprised.

# My anxiety 101

This whole section will be going over the contributing factors to my anxiety disorders and Agoraphobia specifically.

## OCD

To start I'd like to say that my OCD is not the "clean everything now" type. I was diagnosed with it when I was young, but they did not have a specific diagnosis for me at the time and just put it under OCD. As of recent I've found I likely have a form of Tourettic OCD. It is not as much of obsessive thoughts in the way it manifests, as it is physical tics. I have involuntary tics like blinking, tapping, moving my body in weird ways, and pretty much speaking in Simlish. All of those things gravitate around the physical obsession of keeping my bodily feelings even. Even typing this I'm alternating which thumb hits the spacebar because I'm thinking about it a lot. Keep this in mind as we move onto the other weird anxiety stuff I've got going on since whenever my OCD flares up all my other anxiety issues magnify.

## Panic Disorder

On top of the OCD I've got a healthy dose of Severe Panic Disorder. Sometimes spurred by my OCD getting bad, but mostly just social anxiety. If you don't know, Panic Attacks are physical and not just mental. When I would have a Panic Attack I'd experience extreme vasoconstriction, hyperventilating and my vision would start to fade. I'd have this happen almost everyday when I was driving to or at work. Not very fun, I'd say. This could be started by a lot of things. OCD episode, social anxiety, or overstimulation where the most common though. You could imagine if your body was trying to choke you out every time you did something that you'd probably start to avoid those situations. That leads into the most important section.

## Agoraphobia

I have been Agoraphobic for the past three years. It's extremely embarrassing to try to explain to people, because I will get responses from people like "just come with us you'll be fine" or "oh that must be nice to be at home all day". Having to explain Agoraphobia to people who think like this is difficult and sometime frustrating if they think it's all a choice I made. For anyone who doesn't know, Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder where I can't go anywhere I don't trust without having a panic attack. That means that doing very basic tasks like going to the grocery store could very easily leave me hyperventilating without vision on the floor.

I have dealt with this since I was in high school, but it's gotten a lot worse over time. I started to only go out at night, track when and where people gathered to avoid them, and avoided every party/social gathering I could. I was lucky enough to not only land my first job as a software developer, and have an empathetic boss that allowed me to work from home once I explained to him that I was having multiple panic attacks while in the office. As you can imagine, panicking in the bathroom isn't great for productivity. This helped me work on easing into finding places I could feel safe, but after I was laid off due to the CEO doing a ton of shady stuff my baseline anxiety got a lot worse. I wasn't able to drive my car without having a panic attack. I wasn't able to walk around my apartment complex without having a panic attack. I wasn't even able to go to the mailbox without having a panic attack. If you hear "Agoraphobia" and think "oh that must be nice to at home all day" I'd like for you to remember this.

As you could imagine, this level of anxiety doesn't only manifest when I go outside of my safe areas. It bleeds into everything I do. It's made it hard to talk to my friends who don't understand and it's made it hard for me to use social media to share my work. That's right we are finally back to the real overall topic of this post.

# Sharing the work I do is hard

In case you haven't figured it out yet, I am and have always been a very anxious person. I am and have always been creative driven as well. My dad is a graphic designer so I grew up hearing about art all the time. I love making art, music, and especially software, but I haven't shared much of what I've created with anyone. I've always feared showing the things I've created. Not to sound too cringe, but it feels like even the art I create is Agoraphobic and it's only safe area is with me. Putting it freely out on the internet feels like if I walked on stage at a packed concert venue.

# Creative perfection isn't achievable

I am someone with a lot of creative energy. I always feel the need to be making something, whether it be art, music, or software I always have my mind occupied with what I can make. In college this was oddly a point of friction with my friends, because a lot of them wanted to drink and socialize whereas I wanted to brainstorm ideas and make something with them. I wasn't able to make anything with a lot of them, but when I did start projects I became the limiting factor due to my focus on perfection. In retrospect, I was not a fun person to create with. I was essentially sending them homework so they could learn what I was learning, on top of their more important college classes. All just so we could make the perfect music, art, or software.

A big part of why I have issues releasing is because I don't feel like the things I create are worth publishing if they aren't perfect. I have drawn daily for about six months, and haven't even shown my girlfriend most of them because they aren't perfect in my eyes. Even though the most "imperfect" art and music I've made are the most liked pieces when I've shown people. I am someone who loves imperfection in other peoples art. There is personality in imperfection that I love, but that also shows people your vulnerabilities. It allows people to see the creative behind the work more, but with software it just shows literal vulnerabilities.

# Software is creative, but not always art

Software development requires a level of creative thinking that often goes unnoticed. To create a great product, you need a team of creative individuals to ideate infrastructure, design, and architecture. If you can't visualize your idea and how it all fits together, things will fall apart. However, this doesn't mean all software qualifies as "art."

Some software, like [Bruno Simon's site](https://bruno-simon.com/), is art, but software like Facebook isn't. Both involve artistry in their creation, but the key difference is whether you can call your work a "product." Facebook is a product. It needs to be polished to sell ads and capture attention, while Bruno's site can have quirky bugs without risking user experience.

Building a user-facing app demands a high level of perfectionism. Security vulnerabilities, UX errors, and general bugs are inevitable but fixable. This level of precision isn't as critical in painting or music. While both can have mistakes, like a mix error in a song or a security flaw in an API, software is much less forgiving.

# Conclusion

I've been working on sharing my work more with friends and family to finally get over this. I've also added some of my music and art to this site. My final hurdle will be publishing the dozens of software projects I've made over the past four years. Some will be bad, some will be good, and I need to accept that putting it out there for people to see is positive, no matter what.

Striving for perfection is something everyone struggles with. Wanting their code, art, designs, music, or performances to be perfect can stunt their growth. I've felt this way, and it's taken a long time to come to terms with it. I've been thinking about how grateful I am that my distant friend, who passed away, put his music online for people to enjoy. Even when it was just a rough draft, he shared his ideas. That's been a powerful motivator for me to put my creative energy into the world.
