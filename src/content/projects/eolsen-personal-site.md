# Project Overview

## Purpose

I wanted to move my site from Sveltekit to Astro and spruce up aspect of the site for a more fun feel. I wanted to add in a couple of things I have made that I'm proud of and get over my "[publishing agoraphobia](/blog/publishing-agoraphobia)" that I've struggled with for years. Adding elements that I feel represent myself and my process was also an important motivator.

## Tech Stack

### Web Framework: Astro

I am by far the most familiar with Astro as a framework at this point. As a developer that is proficient in multiple frontend UI frameworks (React, Svelte, Solid, etc) Astro allows me to leverage all ecosystems to build faster and stronger applications. It is also the framework that's most similar to Sveltekit and I have had the least issues with in general.

# Challenges Faced

## Porting everything over

This wasn't as challenging as other projects I've ported to other frameworks, but it was time consuming. I didn't have any APIs on the site so I didn't have to change anything from the Sveltekit way to the Astro way, but getting the content was the biggest pain point. I Astro uses a different way of handling markdown routes so setting up the frontmatter schema validator and dumping all the content into a layout was tedious.

## Refining

Refining some actions was a tedious process. Some of the choices I made were definitely bad from a code maintainability perspective, but since it will only be me editing this project I went along with it. This made doing some minor edits frustrating.

# Conclusion

This was a very easy thing to port. I spent a lot of time adding little pieces here and there, but the port itself was easy. I'm proud of the site and feel it represent me more than any other personal site I've made (and I've made too many if I'm being honest).
